['2 garlic cloves, grated on a Microplane', '2 tablespoons apple cider vinegar', '1 tablespoon yellow mustard', '1 tablespoon hot sauce', '1 teaspoon honey', 'Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper', '6 tablespoons vegetable oil', '1 (15-ounce) can black-eyed peas, rinsed and drained', '2 mini cucumbers, cut into ½-inch dice', '½ sweet onion, finely chopped', '1 pint cherry tomatoes or grape tomatoes, halved', '¼ cup picked fresh dill']

Whisk the garlic, vinegar, mustard, hot sauce, honey, 1/4 teaspoon salt, and ¼ teaspoon pepper in a large bowl until smooth. While whisking, add the oil in a slow, steady stream. Whisk until emulsified.
Add the peas, cucumbers, onion, tomatoes, dill, and 1/2 teaspoon salt. Toss until well mixed. You can serve this right away or let it sit at room temperature for up to 1 hour.
