['1 (4-pound) chicken, cut into 8 pieces, skin removed', '1 tablespoon freshly squeezed lime juice', '2 tablespoons Green Seasoning', '1 teaspoon coarse salt', '1 Scotch bonnet pepper or other hot red chili pepper, finely chopped', '2 cloves garlic, crushed', '¼ cup Trinidad Curry Powder', '2 tablespoons canola oil', '1 medium onion, chopped', '1 cup chicken stock or water', 'Roti or white rice', 'for serving']

Place the chicken pieces in a bowl and toss with the lime juice. Drain, rinse the chicken with cold water, and drain again. Remove the chicken from the bowl and pat dry with paper towels.
Place the chicken in another bowl with the Green Seasoning, salt, chili pepper, and garlic. Toss well to coat and refrigerate for at least 30 minutes but ideally overnight.
Combine the curry powder with just enough water to form a thick paste. Heat the oil in a heavy-bottomed pot. Add the curry paste and onion. Cook, stirring constantly, for 1 to 2 minutes over medium-low heat—do not allow the curry to scorch. Add the chicken pieces and stir well to coat. Add the stock or water, cover, and simmer for 30 to 40 minutes, or until the chicken is tender.
Remove the lid and simmer for 5 minutes more over medium-high heat, until the sauce reduces by one-third. Serve with roti or white rice.
