['2 Tbsp. extra-virgin olive oil', '4 lb. ground beef chuck (20% fat)', '4 tsp. kosher salt', 'divided']

Heat oil in a large heavy pot or Dutch oven over high. Add one-quarter (1 lb.) of the ground beef in an even layer, using your hands to break up large pieces and leaving some gaps to encourage browning (instead of steaming). Season with 1 tsp. salt. Cook, undisturbed, until bottom is deeply browned, about 3 minutes. Turn and break into smaller pieces and cook until the other side is browned, 2–3 minutes. Push over to one side of pot. Repeat with another one-quarter (1 lb.) of ground beef, seasoning uncooked meat with 1 tsp. salt. Using a wooden spatula or spoon, break meat into smaller pieces and stir to combine.
Season remaining 2 lb. beef with 2 tsp. salt, then add to pot and cook over medium heat, stirring often and breaking into small pieces, until all meat is cooked through and most (but not all) of the liquid is evaporated from bottom of pot, 12–15 minutes. Let cool to room temperature.
Ground beef can be made 5 days ahead. Divide among airtight containers and chill, or freeze up to 3 months.
