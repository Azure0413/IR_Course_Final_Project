Strawberry Lemonade Shaved Ice

Ingredients
6 tablespoons lemon juice

6 tablespoons white sugar

3 large fresh strawberries, finely chopped

21 large ice cubes

Directions
Mix lemon juice and sugar in a bowl until sugar is dissolved.

Put strawberries in a strainer and place over the bowl. Mash berries against the strainer to extract their juice. Remove strainer and discard mashed berries. Mix strawberry juice with lemonade.

Place ice cubes into a shaved ice machine or snow cone maker. Shave ice into serving bowls and pour strawberry-lemonade over top.

Cook's Note:
We used a Hawaiian(R) ice shaver for this recipe. Any snow cone maker should be fine.
