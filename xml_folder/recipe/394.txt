Ingredients:
['3 tablespoons vegetable oil', '1 small skinless, boneless chicken thigh (about 4 ounces), chopped into 1/4" pieces', '3 ounces squid, coarsely chopped', '2 garlic cloves, finely chopped', '10 ounces fresh rice noodles; or 8 ounces dried pad thai noodles, soaked 1 hour', '1 tablespoon sugar', '2 tablespoons Golden Mountain Seasoning Sauce or Thai thin soy sauce', '1 tablespoon chopped preserved cabbage (optional)', '1 tablespoon chopped preserved sweet radish (optional)', '2 large eggs', '4 scallions, chopped', '1 tablespoon fish sauce', 'Freshly ground white pepper', '2 cups chopped romaine lettuce', 'Hot chili paste (such as sambal oelek; for serving)']

Instructions:
Heat oil in a large skillet over high. Cook chicken, squid, and garlic, stirring, until chicken is almost cooked through and garlic is golden, about 2 minutes. Add noodles and sugar. Cook, stirring, until noodles start to brown and chicken is cooked through, about 2 minutes. Stir in seasoning sauce and cabbage and radish, if using.
Push noodles to the edge of skillet and crack eggs into the center. Let eggs sizzle slightly, then break up yolks and whites with spatula. Cook until whites start to set. Toss noodles into eggs to coat and to form smaller pieces of egg. Cook, undisturbed, until underside is brown. Turn and add scallions and fish sauce. Season with pepper and toss.
