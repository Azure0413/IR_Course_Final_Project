['4 red Fresno or 3 serrano chiles, halved, seeds removed', '3 lemongrass stalks, bottom third only, tough outer layers removed, coarsely chopped', '1 (3") piece ginger, peeled, thinly sliced', '3 garlic cloves, smashed', '1 Tbsp. light brown sugar', '1 tsp. toasted sesame oil', '1/4 cup vegetable oil, plus more for grill', '5 Tbsp. seasoned rice vinegar, divided', '3 lb. 1/4"–1/2"-thick crosscut bone-in beef short ribs (flanken style)', 'Kosher salt', '6 oz. daikon', 'peeled', 'halved lengthwise', 'thinly sliced crosswise']

Purée chiles, lemongrass, ginger, garlic, brown sugar, sesame oil, ¼ cup vegetable oil, and 3 Tbsp. vinegar in a blender or food processor until smooth. Place ribs in a glass baking dish; season generously with salt on both sides. Pour chile paste over and turn ribs to coat. Let sit at room temperature at least 15 minutes and up to 1 hour.
Prepare a grill for high heat; oil grate. Remove ribs from dish and grill until lightly charred and crisp around the edges, about 2 minutes per side. Transfer to a platter and let rest 5 minutes.
While the ribs are resting, combine daikon, a pinch of salt, and remaining 2 Tbsp. vinegar in a medium bowl and toss, massaging with your hands until slightly softened.
To serve, scatter daikon over ribs, leaving any liquid in bowl.
