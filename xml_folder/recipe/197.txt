['1 teaspoon olive oil', '2 (1-inch-thick) boneless pork chops', 'Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper', '2 Granny Smith apples, sliced', '1 cinnamon stick', '2 sage leaves, minced', '1 teaspoon pumpkin pie spice', '1/2 cup unsweetened applesauce', '1/2 cup water']

Set the Instant Pot to “sauté, medium heat.” Once it reads “hot,” add the oil and pork chops, sprinkle lightly with salt and pepper, and brown for 5 minutes, turning them over halfway through.
Transfer the pork chops to a plate. Add the apples, cinnamon stick, sage, pumpkin pie spice, applesauce, and water to the pot. Mix to combine and return the pork chops to the pot.
Cover and cook on high pressure for 10 minutes. Let the pressure release naturally for 10 minutes, then quick-release the remaining pressure.
Remove the pork chops and half the apples to a plate to rest. Set the pot to “sauté, medium heat” and cook to boil down the sauce until thickened, about 10 minutes. Pour the sauce over the pork chops and apples and serve.
