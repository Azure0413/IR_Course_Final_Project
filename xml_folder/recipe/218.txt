Matcha Green Tea Ice Cream

Ingredients
1 tablespoon matcha green tea powder, or more to taste

1 cup whole milk

2 cups heavy whipping cream

Â¾ cup white sugar

2 eggs

Directions
Whisk matcha powder in a bowl to remove any lumps. Add a splash of milk and whisk until matcha powder is completely dissolved. Gradually whisk in remaining milk.

Transfer matcha mixture to a pot. Add cream and cook over medium-low heat, stirring occasionally, until heated through, about 5 minutes.

Whisk sugar and eggs together in a bowl. Pour 1/2 cup hot matcha mixture into egg mixture, whisking quickly until thoroughly combined. Repeat with remaining matcha mixture. Pour mixture back into the pot.

Cook and stir matcha mixture over medium-low heat until heated through, about 3 minutes. Remove from the heat and cool to room temperature, about 20 minutes. Refrigerate until chilled, at least 4 hours.

Pour chilled matcha mixture into an ice cream maker and freeze according to the manufacturer's instructions, about 20 minutes. Transfer to an airtight container and freeze until firm, about 4 hours.
