['12 ounces lean flank steak', '3 tablespoons peanut or vegetable oil', '2 cups julienned carrots', '1 cup julienned celery', '3 small dried red chilies, snipped on one end', '2 tablespoons soy sauce', '1 tablespoon minced ginger', '1 teaspoon minced garlic', '2 teaspoons sesame oil', '2 scallions, finely shredded', '1/2 teaspoon salt', '1/8 teaspoon freshly ground pepper']

Cut the beef with the grain into 2-inch-wide strips. Cut each strip across the grain into 1/4-inch-thick slices, then stack the beef slices and cut across the grain into 2-inch-long matchsticks.
Heat a 14-inch flat-bottomed wok over high heat until a bead of water vaporizes within 1 to 2 seconds of contact. Swirl in 1 tablespoon of the peanut oil, add the carrots, celery, and chilies, then, using a metal spatula, stir-fry 1 minute or until the vegetables have absorbed all of the oil. Transfer the vegetables to a plate.
Swirl the remaining 2 tablespoons peanut oil into the wok, carefully add the beef, and spread it evenly in one layer in the wok. Cook undisturbed 1 minute, letting the beef begin to sear. Then stir-fry 1 minute, or until the beef starts to foam and release its juices. Continue stir-frying 2 to 3 minutes or until almost all the liquid has evaporated and the oil begins to sizzle. Reduce the heat to medium and continue stir-frying 3 minutes until the beef is well browned, all the liquid has disappeared, and the wok is almost dry. Swirl the soy sauce into the wok and stir-fry 30 seconds or until well combined. Add the ginger and garlic and stir-fry 10 seconds or until the aromatics are fragrant. Add the carrot mixture and stir-fry 30 seconds or until well combined. Add the sesame oil and scallions and sprinkle on the salt and pepper.
