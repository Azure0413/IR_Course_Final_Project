['4â€“6 large eggs', '5 Tbsp. unseasoned rice vinegar', '1 Tbsp. honey', '1 Tbsp. tamari or soy sauce', '1/2 tsp. kosher salt', '1/4 cup extra-virgin olive oil, plus more for drizzling', '1 bunch curly kale, stems removed, torn into bite-size pieces', '1 lb. brussels sprouts, trimmed, thinly sliced', '1 cup store-bought or homemade hummus', '1 cup Seedy Power Sprinkle', 'Flaky sea salt']

Bring a medium pot of water to a boil over high heat. Gently lower eggs into water and cook 7 minutes. Transfer to a large bowl of ice water and let sit until cool enough to handle. Peel and slice in half lengthwise.
Meanwhile, whisk vinegar, honey, tamari, kosher salt, and 1/4 cup oil in a large bowl until smooth. Add kale and brussels sprouts. Toss and massage with your hands until kale is darker in color and vegetables are coated in dressing.
Swoosh about 1/4 cup hummus onto side of each bowl. Top with salad and egg halves; season eggs with sea salt. Drizzle oil over and top with seedy sprinkle.
Do Ahead: Unpeeled eggs can be cooked 2 days ahead. Transfer to an airtight container and chill. Kale and brussels sprouts salad can be made 8 hours ahead. Cover and chill.
