['4 medium shallots, 2 chopped, 2 thinly sliced', '6 garlic cloves', '⅓ cup plus 3 Tbsp. fish sauce', '⅓ cup plus 3 Tbsp. fresh lime juice', '3 Tbsp. light brown sugar, divided', '8 (¾"-thick) pork shoulder steaks (3½–4 lb. total)', 'Kosher salt', '2 red or green Thai chiles, thinly sliced', '3 cups Thai or sweet basil leaves', 'cilantro leaves with tender stems', 'and/or dill']

Blend chopped shallots, garlic, ⅓ cup fish sauce, ⅓ cup lime juice, and 2 Tbsp. brown sugar in a blender until smooth.
Season steaks lightly with salt (the fish sauce will also season the steaks). Transfer to a large bowl or a 12x9" baking dish. Pour marinade over and turn steaks with tongs to coat evenly. Let sit at room temperature 1 hour, or cover and chill up to 12 hours, turning once (halfway through if you can).
Preheat a grill to high heat. Grill steaks, turning every minute or 2, until lightly charred and crisp and an instant-read thermometer inserted into the thickest part registers 140°F, 7–9 minutes. Transfer steaks to a cutting board and let rest at least 5 minutes before thinly slicing.
Meanwhile, mix chiles, remaining 3 Tbsp. fish sauce, remaining 3 Tbsp. lime juice, remaining 1 Tbsp. brown sugar, and 1 Tbsp. water in a large bowl to combine. Add sliced shallots and herbs and toss to coat; season lightly with salt.
Arrange sliced meat on a platter and scatter herb salad over.
