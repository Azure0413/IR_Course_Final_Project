['2 1/2 cups all-purpose flour, plus more for dusting', '2 tablespoons sugar', '1 teaspoon salt', '1 cup Earth Balance, chilled and cut into 1-inch pieces', '1/4 to 1/2 cup ice water']

Lightly grease a pie pan and set aside. In a food processor, pulse the flour, sugar, and salt until combined. Add the Earth Balance and pulse for about 15 seconds (it will look like coarse meal). Slowly pour 1/4 cup water into the mixture and pulse until the dough is moist and holds together when pinched. If itâ€™s too dry, add a little more water.
Flour a clean work surface and turn the dough out onto it. Divide into two balls, rolling one out into a 12-inch circle, starting from the center and rolling outward. Place into the pie pan and pinch together the edges of the crust around the pan. Roll out the second ball of dough into a 12-inch circle and either cut into long strips or keep as is.
