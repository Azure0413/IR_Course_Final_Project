['½ cup walnuts', '4 whole pickles (half- or full-sour), halved lengthwise, sliced crosswise into (1") pieces, plus 3 Tbsp. pickle brine', '3 Tbsp. red wine vinegar', '2 tsp. Dijon mustard', '1 tsp. honey', '¼ tsp. crushed red pepper flakes', '½ small white onion, thinly sliced, rinsed', 'Kosher salt, freshly ground pepper', '1 medium fennel bulb, tough outer layers removed, thinly sliced crosswise', '½ cup chopped dill', '2 oz. Parmesan, shaved', 'Extra-virgin olive oil (for drizzling)', 'Toasted country-style bread (for serving; optional)']

Preheat oven to 350°F. Toast walnuts on a rimmed baking sheet, tossing once, until golden brown, 8–10 minutes. Let cool; coarsely chop.
Meanwhile, whisk pickle brine, vinegar, mustard, honey, and red pepper flakes in a large bowl. Add onion and season with salt and pepper. Let sit to allow onion to soften slightly, at least 5 minutes and up to 15 minutes.
Add walnuts, pickles, fennel, dill, and Parmesan to dressing and toss to coat. Transfer salad to a large shallow bowl or platter and drizzle with oil. Serve with toast to sop up the dressing if desired.
