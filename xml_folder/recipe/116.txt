['1/2 cup millet', '1 lb. ground beef chuck (20% fat)', '5 garlic cloves, finely grated', '1 tsp. ground coriander', '1 tsp. freshly ground black pepper', '1 1/2 tsp. kosher salt, plus more', 'Vegetable oil (for frying; about 9 cups)', '1/2 cup tahini', '1 garlic clove, finely grated', '3 Tbsp. fresh lemon juice', 'A deep-fry thermometer']

Cook millet in a dry medium skillet over medium heat, stirring occasionally, until fragrant and lightly toasted, about 3 minutes. Transfer to a small bowl and let cool.
Meanwhile, mix beef, garlic, coriander, pepper, and 1 1/2 tsp. salt in a medium bowl with your hands just to combine; be careful not to overwork.
Working one at a time, roll meat mixture loosely between your palms into 1 3/4" balls (you should have about 18) and place on a rimmed baking sheet. Roll each ball in toasted millet, pressing and packing firmly into meat with your palms. Repeat process as needed until completely coated. Chill meatballs at least 20 minutes and up to 2 hours (this will help the millet adhere during frying).
Pour oil into a large heavy pot fitted with a deep-fry thermometer to come 1 1/2" up sides; heat over medium until thermometer hits 350Â°F.
Meanwhile, combine tahini and garlic in a medium bowl. Gradually add 6 Tbsp. water, then lemon juice, whisking constantly until sauce is smooth and pourable. Season with salt.
Using a slotted spoon, gently lower meatballs into oil and fry undisturbed 2 1/2 minutes (millet will be light golden). Transfer to a baking sheet lined with paper towels; season lightly with salt. Serve meatballs with tahini sauce.
