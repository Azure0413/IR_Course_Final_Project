['3/4 cup extra-virgin olive oil', '1/4 cup fresh lemon juice', '2 Tbsp. Dijon mustard', '1 tsp. honey', '1 tsp. freshly ground black pepper', '1 tsp. kosher salt, plus more', '6 large eggs', '1 lb. green beans, trimmed; asparagus, trimmed; and/or new or baby potatoes, halved if larger', '4 cups halved or sliced radishes, seedless cucumbers, fennel, and/or tomatoes', '3 cups shredded rotisserie chicken, oil-packed tuna, cooked salmon or steak, cooked lentils, or canned white beans or chickpeas', 'Olives, capers, peperoncini, pickles, or other pickled-briny ingredients (for serving)', 'Flaky sea salt']

Whisk oil, lemon juice, mustard, honey, pepper, and 1 tsp. kosher salt in a medium bowl; set dressing aside.
Bring a medium pot of salted water to a boil. Carefully add eggs and cook 7 minutes. Using a slotted spoon, transfer eggs to a bowl of ice water (keep pot over high heat); chill until cold, about 5 minutes. Peel; set aside.
Meanwhile, add green beans, asparagus, or potatoes to the same pot of boiling water and cook until just tender (if you are using a combination, cook vegetables separately), 2–4 minutes for green beans or asparagus, 10–15 minutes for potatoes. Using a slotted spoon, transfer to bowl of ice water; let sit until cold, about 3 minutes. Transfer to paper towels; pat dry.
To serve, slice eggs in half and arrange on a platter with cooked and raw vegetables and protein. Top with pickled-briny ingredient(s), sprinkle with sea salt, and drizzle some reserved dressing over. Serve with remaining dressing alongside.
Do Ahead: Dressing can be made 5 days ahead; cover and chill. Eggs can be boiled and vegetables blanched 2 days ahead; cover and chill separately.
