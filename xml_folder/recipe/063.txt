['1½ lb. skinless, boneless chicken thighs (4–8 depending on size)', 'Kosher salt, freshly ground pepper', '3 Tbsp. unsalted butter, divided', '2 large or 3 medium leeks, white and pale green parts only, halved lengthwise, thinly sliced', 'Zest and juice of 1 lemon, divided', '1½ cups long-grain white rice, rinsed until water runs clear', '2¾ cups low-sodium chicken broth', '1 oil-packed anchovy fillet', '2 garlic cloves', '1 Tbsp. drained capers', 'Crushed red pepper flakes', '1 cup tender herb leaves (such as parsley, cilantro, and/or mint)', '4–5 Tbsp. extra-virgin olive oil']

Season chicken with salt and pepper. Melt 2 Tbsp. butter in a large high-sided skillet over medium-high heat. Add leeks and half of lemon zest, season with salt and pepper, and mix to coat leeks in butter. Reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and cook, stirring occasionally, until leeks are somewhat tender, about 5 minutes. Remove lid, increase heat to medium-high, and cook, stirring occasionally, until tender and just starting to take on color, about 3 minutes. Add rice and cook, stirring often, 3 minutes, then add broth, scraping up any browned bits. Tuck short sides of each chicken thigh underneath so they are touching and nestle seam side down into rice mixture. Bring to a simmer. Cover, reduce heat to medium-low, and cook until rice is tender and chicken is cooked through, about 20 minutes. Remove from heat. Cut remaining 1 Tbsp. butter into small pieces and scatter over mixture. Re-cover and let sit 10 minutes.
Meanwhile, pulse anchovy, garlic, capers, a few pinches of red pepper flakes, and remaining lemon zest in a food processor until finely chopped. Add herbs; process until a paste forms. With motor running, gradually stream in oil until loosened to a thick sauce. Add half of lemon juice; season salsa verde with salt.
Drizzle remaining lemon juice over chicken and rice. Serve with salsa verde.
