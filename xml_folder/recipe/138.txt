Fried Ice Cream

Ingredients
1 quart vanilla ice cream

3 cups crushed cornflakes cereal

1 teaspoon ground cinnamon

3 egg whites

2 quarts oil for frying

Directions
Gather all ingredients.

Scoop ice cream into eight 1/2-cup-sized balls.

Place on a baking sheet and freeze until firm, about 1 hour.

Combine cornflakes and cinnamon in a shallow dish. Beat egg whites until foamy in a separate bowl.

Roll ice cream balls in egg whites.

Then in cornflakes, covering ice cream completely. Repeat if necessary. Freeze again until firm, about 3 hours.

Heat oil in a deep-fryer or large, heavy saucepan to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Using a basket or slotted spoon, fry ice cream balls 1 or 2 at a time in hot oil until golden, 10 to 15 seconds.

Drain quickly on paper towels and serve immediately.

Editor's Note
We have determined the nutritional value of oil for frying based on a retention value of 10% after cooking. The exact amount may vary depending on cook time and temperature, ingredient density, and the specific type of oil used.
