Chilled Cucumber-Dill Soup

Ingredients
4 large cucumbers - peeled, seeded, and cubed, divided

½ cup finely chopped yellow onion, divided

½ cup finely chopped celery, divided

½ cup grated carrots, divided

4 medium jalapeno peppers, seeded and finely chopped

¼ cup Greek yogurt

¼ cup sour cream

2 teaspoons white sugar

1 teaspoon garlic powder

1 teaspoon dried dill weed

1 teaspoon salt, or more to taste

1 teaspoon ground black pepper, or more to taste

Directions
Set 1/4 cup of cubed cucumber aside.

Place remaining cucumbers, 1/4 cup onion, 1/4 cup celery, 1/4 cup carrots, jalapeno peppers, Greek yogurt, sour cream, sugar, garlic powder, dill, salt, and pepper into the bowl of an 8-cup electric blender or food processor and pulse until all ingredients are just blended.

Pour into a large bowl and stir in reserved 1/4 cup cucumber and remaining onion, celery, and carrots to add a little crunch to an otherwise creamy mixture. Taste for salt and pepper, adding more if desired.

Place into the refrigerator for at least 4 hours before serving.

Cook's Notes:
You can use serrano peppers instead of jalapeno, red pepper flakes instead of black pepper, and 1 packet of Equal(R) instead of white sugar, if preferred.

If using fresh dill instead of dried, add 2 to 3 teaspoons.
