Ingredients:
['One 28-oz. can whole peeled tomatoes', '2 anchovies', '2 garlic cloves', '6 tablespoons olive oil', '1/4 cup basil leaves', 'Salt', 'Pepper', '12 ounces fresh mozzarella, grated', 'Grandma-Style Pizza Dough']

Instructions:
Drain one 28-oz. can whole peeled tomatoes and pulse tomatoes with 2 anchovies, 2 garlic cloves, 6 tablespoons olive oil, and 1/4 cup basil leaves in a food processor or blender until mostly smooth (some texture is okay); season with salt and pepper.
A classic Grandma-just sauce and mozzarella-flips the usual script: Add cheese before sauce. Master this basic pie and you're ready to improvise (see below for ideas).
Place a rack in lower third of oven and preheat to 525Â° or as high as oven will go.
Once Grandma-Style Pizza Dough has risen on baking sheet, top with 12 ounces fresh mozzarella, grated, and dot pie with 1 1/2 cups Fresh Tomato Pizza Sauce. Bake pie until golden brown and crisp on bottom and sides, 20-30 minutes.
