Cake Batter Ice Cream

Ingredients
2 cups heavy whipping cream

1 cup milk

¾ cup white cake mix, sifted

½ cup white sugar

2 large egg yolks, beaten

1 teaspoon vanilla extract

Directions
Whisk together cream, milk, cake mix, sugar, egg yolks, and vanilla in a saucepan until well blended. Cook, stirring frequently, over medium-low heat until mixture reaches 160 degrees F (70 degrees C). Pour into a heat-proof container and place in the refrigerator or freezer until chilled.

Pour chilled mixture into an ice cream maker and freeze according to manufacturer's directions until it reaches soft-serve consistency. Transfer ice cream to a 1- or 2-quart lidded plastic container; cover surface with plastic wrap and seal. For best results, ice cream should ripen in the freezer for at least 2 hours or overnight.
