['2 medium red onions', '4 oz. bacon, finely chopped', '1 lb. ground beef (20% fat)', '3 1/2 tsp. kosher salt, divided', '6 garlic cloves, peeled, smashed', '2 tsp. ground cumin', '1 tsp. smoked paprika', '3 Tbsp. harissa paste', '4 cups homemade beef stock or low-sodium beef broth', '1 1/2 lb. sweet potatoes, peeled, finely chopped', '1/2 lb. dried kidney beans', 'Sour cream, cilantro, and finely grated cheddar cheese (for serving)', 'An Instant Pot or pressure cooker']

Finely chop onions. Set aside 1/2 cup for serving.
Place bacon in Instant Pot and cook on Sauté setting (or cook over medium-high heat in pressure cooker), stirring occasionally, until dark golden brown and most of the fat is rendered, 6–8 minutes. Using a slotted spoon, transfer bacon to a medium bowl.
Let pot heat up again for at least 2 minutes before adding beef; season with 2 tsp. salt. Cook, undisturbed, until browned underneath, 8–10 minutes. Break into bite-size pieces, then transfer to bowl with bacon. Add remaining chopped onion, garlic, cumin, and paprika to pot and cook, stirring occasionally, until softened, about 5 minutes. Add harissa and cook, stirring constantly, until it starts to stick to bottom of pot, about 2 minutes. Add stock, potatoes, beans, and remaining 1/2 tsp. salt, stirring to combine. Return reserved bacon and beef to pot and stir again to combine.
Lock lid and cook chili at high pressure 40 minutes. Let steam release naturally. Stir chili until most of the potatoes have broken down (they will thicken the chili in the process and become part of the liquid). If chili seems too thick, stir in a little bit of water or more stock to loosen. Taste and season with salt if needed.
Divide chili among bowls. Top with sour cream, cilantro, cheese, and reserved onion.
