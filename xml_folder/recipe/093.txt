Coffee Milkshake

Ingredients
1 shot espresso

4 ounces milk

3 tablespoons malted milk powder

1 3/4 cup coffee ice cream

1 tablespoon dark chocolate syrup, such as ToraniÂ®, or as needed (optional)

2 tablespoons whipped cream, or as needed (optional)

Directions
Pour cooled espresso shot and milk into a high-powered blender, such as a Vitamix. Add the malted milk powder and ice cream. Secure lid; blend on High until smooth, about 45 seconds.

Drizzle syrup on the inside of a glass. Pour milkshake into glass. Add whipped topping.

Cook's Note:
I use a Vitamix blender. If you have a regular blender, blend until smooth.
