['1 tablespoon vegetable oil', '1 shallot, chopped', '4 garlic cloves, finely chopped', '1 dried chile (such as chile de árbol)', '1 pound ground pork', '1 tablespoon fish sauce', '1 tablespoon soy sauce', 'Pinch of sugar', '1 cup low-sodium chicken broth', '2 teaspoons unseasoned rice vinegar', 'Kosher salt']

Heat oil in a medium skillet over medium-high. Cook shallot, garlic, and chile, stirring often, until shallot is softened and translucent, about 4 minutes. Add pork and cook, stirring occasionally, until almost cooked through, about 3 minutes. Add fish sauce, soy sauce, and sugar and cook, stirring occasionally, until moisture in skillet is evaporated, about 5 minutes. Add broth, reduce heat, and simmer, uncovered, stirring occasionally, until liquid is evaporated, 12–18 minutes.
Remove skillet from heat and mix vinegar into pork mixture; taste and season with salt if needed.
