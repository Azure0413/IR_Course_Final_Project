['1 1/2 cups extra-virgin olive oil', '3/4 cup any combination red wine vinegar, white wine vinegar, and/or apple cider vinegar', '1 Tbsp. Dijon mustard', '1 Tbsp. honey', 'Kosher salt', '8 oz. mixed tender greens', '1 cup torn tender herbs (optional)', 'Kosher salt']

Combine oil, vinegars, mustard, and honey in a large resealable jar or airtight container; cover and shake vigorously until emulsified, about 30 seconds. Season with salt.
Do Ahead: Vinaigrette can be made 1 month ahead. Cover and chill. Shake to re-emulsify.
Drizzle 3 Tbsp. vinaigrette into a large bowl, coating sides and bottom of bowl. Add greens and herbs (if using). Using your hands, fold greens, working from the bottom, out and up the sides of the bowl, until evenly coated in vinaigrette. Season with salt until greens taste vibrant (you may need to season and toss a few times). Mound salad, higher than wide, on plates or in shallow bowls.
