Ingredients:
['4 sheets matzo', '1 large egg, separated', '5 tablespoons sugar', '1/2 cup pine nuts', '1/3 cup raisins', '1 1/2 teaspoons orange zest', 'Pinch of sea salt', 'Neutral oil, for frying', 'Honey, for serving']

Instructions:
Break the matzo into large pieces and place them in a medium bowl. Pour over about 1½ cups water, being sure that the edges of the matzo are covered. Soak the pieces for 15 minutes, turning them every 5 minutes, until soft and damp and no hard bits remain.
Drain and squeeze any excess water out of the matzo and transfer to a separate medium bowl. Add the egg yolk, sugar, pine nuts, raisins, orange zest, and salt and mix well. In a separate medium bowl, beat the egg white to stiff peaks. Gently fold the egg white into the matzo mixture until no streaks remain, taking care not to deflate.
In a small skillet, heat 2 inches of neutral oil to 350°F. Using two spoons or a small ice cream scoop, carefully drop small rounds of the batter into the hot oil. Fry in batches for 5 minutes or until golden brown, turning once to ensure even cooking.
Drain on paper towels for a few minutes, then transfer to a plate and drizzle with honey before serving.
