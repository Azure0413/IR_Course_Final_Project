['3 Tbsp. peanut or vegetable oil', '1 (14â€“16-oz.) package firm or extra-firm tofu, drained, cut into 2x1/2" planks', '2 medium bell peppers, seeds and ribs removed, sliced into thin strips', '8 oz. flat wide brown or white rice noodles', '1/4 cup smooth natural peanut butter', '3 Tbsp. soy sauce or tamari', '3 Tbsp. unseasoned rice vinegar', '2 Tbsp. brown sugar', '1 Tbsp. fish sauce', '2 Tbsp. fresh lime juice', '4 oz. baby spinach', '1/4 cup cilantro leaves', '1/4 cup roasted salted peanuts, chopped', 'Lime wedges (for serving)']
