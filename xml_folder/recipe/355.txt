['1 pound (455 g) strip steak (about 1 inch/2.5 cm thick; see Tip), trimmed and at room temperature', 'Vegetable oil', 'Salt and pepper', '1 large head of butter lettuce, also known as Boston or Bibb, leaves torn into bite-size pieces', '1/2 English cucumber, halved lengthwise and sliced', '1/2 pint (120 g) cherry tomatoes, halved', '1/2 small red onion, halved lengthwise and thinly sliced', 'Handful of fresh mint leaves, roughly chopped', 'Large handful of fresh cilantro leaves, roughly chopped', 'Chile-Lime Sauce', 'Handful of roasted peanuts', 'whole or roughly chopped (optional)']

Preheat the broiler, with a rack positioned so that the meat will be 3 to 4 inches (7.5 to 10 cm) from the heat. Line the bottom of a broiler pan with foil for easier clean-up, if you like, then top with the broiler rack. Put the meat on the broiler rack, lightly coat with the oil, and season with salt and pepper. Broil the meat for 5 to 7 minutes per side for medium-rare (err on the side of caution with the time; you can always cook it more). Transfer to a cutting board, sprinkle with salt, and let rest for 5 to 10 minutes.
Meanwhile, in a large bowl, combine the lettuce, cucumbers, tomatoes, onions, mint, and cilantro.*
Cut the meat against the grain into very thin slices and add to the bowl. (If the meat is still hot, wait a few minutes until it is warm or it will wilt the lettuce and herbs.) Drizzle the salad with just enough Chile-Lime Sauce to lightly coat and gently toss together. Top with the peanuts, if you like.
Prepare to *, then cover and refrigerate the lettuce mixture and the unsliced meat separately for up to 1 day. The meat can be sliced and added to the salad cold or you can warm it in a 300°F (150°C) oven, if you prefer.
If the salad will be served within 1 hour or so, cover the lettuce mixture and meat separately and leave them on the counter. People can help themselves and then toss their individual portions with the dressing.
