['1 fennel bulb, sliced', '1 large red onion, cut through root end into 8 wedges', '1 lb. baby Yukon Gold potatoes, halved if large', '3 Tbsp. extra-virgin olive oil', 'Kosher salt', '4 Tbsp. unsalted butter', '2 garlic cloves, crushed', '1 (1/2") piece ginger, peeled, finely chopped', '1 tsp. curry powder', '1 1/4 lb. piece cod, hake, haddock, or pollock', 'Mint (for serving)']

Preheat oven to 425°F. Toss fennel, onion, potatoes, and oil in a 3-qt. baking dish to coat; season with salt. Roast, tossing once, until vegetables are browned and softened, 35–40 minutes.
Meanwhile, melt butter in a small saucepan over medium heat. Mix in garlic, ginger, curry powder, and a pinch of salt. Simmer until color intensifies, about 1 minute. Remove from heat.
Season fish with salt and lay on top of cooked vegetables. Drizzle fish with curry butter. Reduce oven temperature to 350°F and bake fish until flesh easily flakes apart with a fork, 12–15 minutes.
Serve vegetables and fish with mint scattered over.
