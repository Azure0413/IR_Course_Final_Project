['1/3 cup chopped golden raisins', '1/4 cup apple cider vinegar', '1/3 cup pine nuts', '1 lb. small tomatoes (such as Sun Gold, cherry, and/or grape), some halved, some left whole', '1/2 small red onion, very thinly sliced', '1/4 cup extra-virgin olive oil', '1 cup basil leaves, torn if large', '2 Tbsp. pomegranate molasses', 'Kosher salt']

Preheat oven to 350°F. Combine raisins and vinegar in a large bowl; let sit until raisins soften, 15–20 minutes.
Meanwhile, toast pine nuts on a rimmed baking sheet, tossing halfway through, until golden brown, 5–7 minutes. Let cool.
Add pine nuts, tomatoes, red onion, and oil to bowl with raisins; season with salt and gently toss to combine. Add basil and toss once more.
Transfer salad to a platter and drizzle pomegranate molasses over.
