['3/4 cup extra-virgin olive oil, divided', '1 small lemon, thinly sliced into rounds, seeds removed', '8 oz. feta', '1 Tbsp. chopped oregano', 'Kosher salt, freshly ground pepper', '4 Jimmy Nardello or other sweet Italian frying peppers', '1 small red onion, very thinly sliced', '1 large Japanese or Armenian cucumber or 2 medium Persian cucumbers, peeled, cut into 1½" pieces', '1 lb. small tomatoes (such as Sun Gold and/or cherry), some halved, some left whole', '2 Tbsp. red wine vinegar']

Heat 1/4 cup oil in a large skillet over medium-high. Add lemon slices and cook until lightly charred around the edges, about 2 minutes per side. Transfer lemon slices to a medium bowl. Set aside skillet with oil.
Break feta into large pieces and add to bowl with charred lemons along with oregano and remaining 1/2 cup oil; season mixture lightly with salt and generously with black pepper. Toss very gently to coat and set aside.
Set reserved skillet over medium-high heat and add frying peppers. Cook, shaking pan occasionally, until skins are lightly charred and flesh is tender, 6–8 minutes. Transfer peppers to a cutting board and let cool slightly, then cut in half lengthwise.
Toss onion, cucumber, tomatoes, vinegar, and a large pinch of salt in a large bowl. Add frying peppers and lightly toss again to combine. Transfer salad to a platter and scatter marinated feta with lemon slices and oil over.
