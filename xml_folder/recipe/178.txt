Homemade Peach Ice Cream

Ingredients
2 ½ pounds fresh peaches - peeled, pitted and chopped

1 pint half-and-half cream

½ cup white sugar

1 (14 ounce) can sweetened condensed milk

1 (12 fluid ounce) can evaporated milk

1 teaspoon vanilla extract

2 cups whole milk, or as needed

Directions
Gather all ingredients.

Working in batches, purée peaches with half-and-half and sugar in a blender or food processor.

Mix peach mixture, sweetened condensed milk, evaporated milk, and vanilla in a gallon ice cream freezer container. Pour enough whole milk into the container to reach the fill line, about 2 cups. Pour mixture into an ice cream maker.

Freeze according to manufacturer's instructions, about 20 minutes. Transfer to an airtight container and freeze until firm, about 4 hours.

Recipe Tips
If you prefer ice cream on the sweeter side, you may use up to 1 cup sugar in this recipe.

Chilling the container first will help the ice cream harden faster.v
