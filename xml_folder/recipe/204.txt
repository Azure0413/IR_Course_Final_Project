Cover jar and place in the freezer for 3 to 4 hours, stirring every 30 to 40 minutes.

Recipe Tips
The vodka is optional. However, it really helps keep the ice cream scoopable, and you don't taste it!

Freezing for 3 to 4 hours produces the best consistency; however, if you'd like to soften it a bit, 10 seconds in the microwave does the trick, or remove from the freezer 15 minutes ahead of time.

You can pulse granular sweetener in a blender or food processor to achieve a powdered consistency.

You can use different flavored extracts for variety.
