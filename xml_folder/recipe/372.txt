Ingredients:
['1 pound pizza dough, thawed if frozen', '1/2 pound sliced mushrooms', '3/4 pound cold Taleggio or Italian Fontina, rind discarded and cheese sliced', '1 teaspoon white truffle oil (optional)']

Instructions:
Put a large heavy baking sheet (17 by 14 inches) on lowest rack of oven, then preheat oven to 500Â°F.
Stretch out dough on a lightly floured surface, pulling on corners to form a roughly 16- by 13-inch rectangle. Transfer to a tray lined with parchment paper. Lightly prick dough all over with a fork.
Slide dough (still on parchment) onto hot baking sheet. Bake until top is puffed and pale golden in patches, 6 to 10 minutes.
Remove from oven; prick any large bubbles with a fork and flatten. Scatter mushrooms over crust, then season with salt and pepper and lay cheese on top.
Bake pizza until edge of crust is deep golden and cheese is bubbling and golden in patches, 8 to 10 minutes. Drizzle with truffle oil (if using) and season with pepper. Serve immediately.
