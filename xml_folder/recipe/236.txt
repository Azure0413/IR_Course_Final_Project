['1 cup short-grain sushi rice', '8 scallions', '1 (1") piece ginger, peeled, finely grated', '3 Tbsp. vegetable oil, divided', '1½ lb. skinless, boneless cod, cut into 2” pieces', 'Kosher salt', '2 tsp. freshly ground black pepper', '1 Tbsp. unseasoned rice vinegar', '1 tsp. sugar', '2 Tbsp. unsalted butter', 'cut into pieces']

Rinse rice in several changes of cold water in a medium bowl until water runs clear. Drain well, then transfer to a small saucepan. Pour in 1¼ cups cold water and bring to a boil over medium-high heat. Give rice a stir so grains don’t stick to the bottom. Cover pot and reduce heat to lowest setting. Cook, undisturbed, until water is evaporated and rice is tender, 18–20 minutes. Remove from heat and let sit, still covered, 10 minutes.
Meanwhile, trim dark green tops from scallions and thinly slice; set aside. Thinly slice white and pale green parts of scallions of a deep diagonal. Set aside separately.
Mix ginger and 2 Tbsp. oil in a medium bowl. Add cod and season with salt and sprinkle all over with pepper. Toss to coat.
Heat remaining 1 Tbsp. oil in a large nonstick skillet over medium-high. Cook cod, undisturbed, until golden underneath, about 2 minutes. Turn over and scatter reserved white and pale green scallion parts on top. Cook, shaking the pan a few times, until fish is cooked through and some scallions are caramelized and some are just slightly softened, about 2 minutes. Remove from heat.
Stir vinegar and sugar in a small bowl until sugar dissolves. Mix into rice. Add butter and reserved dark green scallion tops and gently stir until butter is melted. Season with salt.
Transfer rice to a platter and top with fish; pour any pan juices over.
