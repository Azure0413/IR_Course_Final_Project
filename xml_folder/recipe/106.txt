['1/2 cup crab claw meat, bits removed', '2 cups boiled crawfish tails', '1/2 pound boiled, peeled shrimp', '2 large celery stalks, sliced (about 1 cup)', '1/4 cup green bell pepper', '3/4 teaspoon salt', '1/8 teaspoon ground black pepper', '1/2 cup mayonnaise', '3 tablespoons lemon juice', 'Pinch of cayenne pepper']

Mix everything together in a bowl and then refrigerate until you are ready to serve. Itâ€™s really that easy. (I like to mix the mayo and lemon juice together before stirring it into the rest of the ingredients.)
Do Ahead: Will keep in an airtight container for up to three days before getting funky.
