Ingredients:
['Kosher salt', '12 oz. wide rice noodles', '1/4 cup extra-virgin olive oil', '6 garlic cloves, thinly sliced', '1 Fresno chile or red jalapeño, thinly sliced', '2 large sprigs basil, plus torn leaves for serving', '3 pints cherry tomatoes, halved if large', 'Chili oil and toasted sesame seeds (for serving)']

Instructions:
Bring a large saucepan of salted water to a boil. Remove from heat; add noodles. Let sit, stirring occasionally, until al dente, about 4 minutes (time may vary by brand). Drain and rinse under cold running water.
Meanwhile, heat olive oil in a large skillet over medium. Cook garlic, stirring often, until softened and golden, about 3 minutes. Add chile and basil sprigs; cook, stirring, just until softened, about 1 minute. Add tomatoes and 1/4 cup water and cook, stirring occasionally, until most of the tomatoes have burst and are jammy, 8–10 minutes. Season with salt.
Add noodles to sauce and toss to coat. Season with more salt if needed. Divide among bowls; drizzle with chili oil and top with sesame seeds and torn basil.
