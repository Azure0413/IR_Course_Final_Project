Ingredients:
['2 garlic cloves, finely grated', '1 (28-ounce) can crushed tomatoes', '2 tablespoons olive oil', '1 1/2 teaspoons fine sea salt']

Instructions:
Whisk garlic, tomatoes, oil, and salt in a medium bowl. Donâ€™t be tempted to add more salt; the flavor will concentrate when sauce is baked with pizza. Cover and chill 3 hours to let flavors come together before using.
Sauce can be made 1 week ahead. Keep chilled.
