['2 medium sweet potatoes (about 9 ounces each), cut into 8 pieces lengthwise', '1 tablespoon olive oil', '1 1/2 teaspoons kosher salt, divided', '3/4 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper, divided', '4 ears of corn, shucked', '1/2 cup (1 stick) unsalted butter, room temperature', '2 tablespoons finely chopped tender herbs (such as cilantro, chives, and/or parsley)', '1/2 cup barbecue sauce', '1 tablespoon honey mustard', '4 (1"-thick) bone-in pork chops (about 2 1/2 pounds total)', '1/4 cup finely grated Parmesan (about 0.7 ounces)']

Preheat oven to 450°F. Toss potatoes with oil, 1/2 tsp. salt, and 1/4 tsp. pepper on a rimmed baking sheet. Add corn cobs and roast, tossing halfway through, until potatoes are tender and corn is cooked through and beginning to brown, 15–20 minutes.
Meanwhile, mix butter, herbs, and remaining 1 tsp. salt and 1/2 tsp. pepper in a small bowl. Whisk barbecue sauce and honey mustard in another small bowl.
Preheat broiler on high and set oven rack about 4" from heat. Line broiler pan or another rimmed baking sheet with foil. Using a pastry brush, slather pork chops with about half of barbecue sauce mixture and transfer to prepared pan; reserve remaining barbecue sauce mixture.
Broil pork chops, turning and brushing with remaining barbecue sauce mixture halfway through, until cooked through, about 15 minutes.
Spread each corn cob with 1 Tbsp. herb butter; serve remaining herb butter alongside. Top potatoes with Parmesan.
Divide pork chops and potatoes among plates. Serve with corn alongside.
