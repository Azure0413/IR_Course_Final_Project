Ingredients:
['Kosher salt', '5 oz. rice vermicelli', '2 Tbsp. virgin coconut oil or vegetable oil', '1 small red onion, thinly sliced', '4 garlic cloves, thinly sliced', '1 (1") piece ginger, peeled, finely grated', '1 tsp. ground turmeric', '1 tsp. coarsely ground black pepper, plus more', '1 (13.5-oz.) can unsweetened coconut milk', '1 1/2 tsp. honey', '1 Tbsp. fish sauce', 'Toasted unsweetened shredded coconut (for serving)']

Instructions:
Bring a large saucepan of salted water to a boil. Remove from heat; add noodles. Let sit, stirring occasionally, until al dente, about 4 minutes (time may vary by brand). Drain and rinse under cold running water.
Meanwhile, heat oil in a large saucepan over medium. Cook onion and garlic, stirring often, until softened and golden, about 3 minutes. Add ginger, turmeric, and 1 tsp. pepper and cook, stirring, just until fragrant, about 1 minute. Add coconut milk, honey, and 1/4 cup water. Bring to a simmer; cook until flavors come together, about 5 minutes.
Mix fish sauce and noodles into broth; season with salt if needed. Divide among bowls and top with shredded coconut and more pepper.
