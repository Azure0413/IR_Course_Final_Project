Butter Pecan Ice Cream

Ingredients
1 tablespoon butter

⅓ cup chopped pecans

2 large eggs

1 ½ cups half-and-half cream

1 cup brown sugar

½ cup heavy cream

1 teaspoon vanilla extract

Directions
Melt butter in a small skillet over medium heat. Cook and stir pecans in hot butter until lightly browned and fragrant, 3 to 5 minutes. Set aside.

Whisk eggs in a large bowl; set aside.

Combine half-and-half and brown sugar in a saucepan and mix well. Bring to a boil over medium-high heat; remove from heat. Gradually pour hot mixture into eggs, whisking constantly. Return custard to the saucepan and cook, stirring occasionally, until mixture thickens enough to coat the back of a spoon. The custard mixture is ready when you can draw your finger down the back of the coated spoon and see a clear line. Remove from heat and stir in cream, pecans, and vanilla.

Pour into an ice cream maker and freeze according to manufacturers' directions.
