['2 envelopes active dry yeast', '1/4 cup safflower or extra-virgin olive oil', '2 tablespoons natural granulated sugar', '2 cups whole-wheat flour', '3 cups unbleached all-purpose flour', '1 teaspoon salt']

Combine the yeast with 2 cups warm water in a medium bowl. Let stand for 10 minutes to dissolve. Stir in the oil and sugar.
In a large mixing bowl, combine the flours and salt. Make a well in the center and stir in the yeast mixture. Work everything together, first with a wooden spoon and then with your hands, to form a dough.
Turn out the dough onto a well-floured board and knead it for 8 minutes, adding flour until the dough loses its stickiness. Place the dough in a floured bowl, cover it with a tea towel, and put it in a warm place. Let it rise until doubled in bulk, about 1 to 1 1/2 hours.
Punch the dough down and divide it into two rounds. Roll out one round on a well-floured board into a circle about 12 to 14 inches in diameter. Repeat with the other round.
Sprinkle two 12â€“14-inch pizza pans with cornmeal. Lay the rounds on the pans and stretch to fit. Arrange the toppings of your choice on the dough and bake as directed.
