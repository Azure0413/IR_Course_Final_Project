['1 (1 1/4-lb.) pork tenderloin', '3 Tbsp. sambal oelek', '2 Tbsp. light brown sugar', '1 (1") piece ginger, peeled, finely grated', '1 garlic clove, finely grated', '3 Tbsp. soy sauce, divided', '2 1/4 tsp. toasted sesame oil, divided', '3 Tbsp. vegetable oil, divided', 'Kosher salt', '2 medium carrots, peeled, sliced', '1 bunch collard greens or Tuscan kale, ribs and stems removed, leaves sliced', '1 Tbsp. seasoned rice vinegar', 'Steamed white rice', 'thinly sliced scallions', 'and gochujang (Korean hot pepper paste; for serving)']

Freeze tenderloin until firm around the edges, 30â€“45 minutes, if time permits.
Combine sambal oelek, brown sugar, ginger, garlic, 2 Tbsp. soy sauce, and 2 tsp. sesame oil in a resealable plastic bag.
Thinly slice pork with a long, sharp knife. Add to marinade, seal bag, and knead to coat. Let sit at least 10 minutes and up to 2 hours.
Heat 1 Tbsp. vegetable oil in a large nonstick skillet over medium-high. Add half of pork in a single layer; season lightly with salt. Cook, undisturbed, until browned underneath, about 1 minute. Toss pork, then continue to cook, tossing, until cooked through, about 1 minute more. Transfer to a plate. Repeat with another 1 Tbsp. vegetable oil and remaining pork. Wipe out skillet.
Heat remaining 1 Tbsp. vegetable oil in skillet over medium-high. Add carrots in a single layer and cook, undisturbed, until starting to soften and brown underneath, about 2 minutes. Add collard greens and toss to wilt. Cook, tossing occasionally, until vegetables are crisp-tender, about 2 minutes.
Combine vinegar and remaining 1 Tbsp. soy sauce and 1/4 tsp. sesame oil in a small bowl.
Divide rice among bowls; arrange vegetables and pork over. Drizzle with dressing and top with scallions. Serve gochujang alongside.
