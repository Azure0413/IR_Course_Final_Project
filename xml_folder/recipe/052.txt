Carrot Cake Ice Cream

Ingredients
2 tablespoons unsalted butter

1 1/4 cups finely shredded carrots

1/3 cup brown sugar

1/4 teaspoon kosher salt

1 1/4 teaspoons cinnamon

1/2 teaspoon ground ginger

4 ounces soft cream cheese

1 can (14 ounces) sweetened condensed milk

1 teaspoon vanilla extract

2 1/4 cups heavy cream

1/3 cup toasted chopped pecans

1/3 cup chopped walnuts

Directions
Combine butter, carrots, brown sugar, and salt in a saucepan over medium heat. Cook and stir until carrots are just getting tender, about 5 minutes. Season with cinnamon and ginger. Cook for 1 more minute. Turn off heat, and let cool.

Meanwhile, whisk together cream cheese, sweetened condensed milk, and vanilla extract in a bowl until smooth. Stir in cooled carrot mixture and transfer to the refrigerator until needed.

Beat cream in a chilled glass or metal bowl with an electric mixer until medium-stiff  peaks form. Add cooled carrot-cream cheese mixture and whisk into the whipped cream. Fold in chopped walnuts and pecans with a spatula.

Transfer mixture into a chilled airtight container and place a piece of plastic wrap directly onto the mixture. Cover with a lid and freeze until solid, at least 4 hours, but best overnight.
