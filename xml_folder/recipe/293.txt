Ingredients:
['1 pound store-bought pizza dough,room temperature', '3 tablespoons plus 1/3 cup extra-virgin olive oil', '3 garlic cloves, finely grated', 'Kosher salt, freshly ground pepper', '1 large head of Bibb lettuce, leaves separated and torn', '4 ounces Gorgonzola, crumbled (about 1 1/2 cups)', '1/2 cup pickled red onion', '3 tablespoons sliced chives', '4 ounces thinly sliced prosciutto, but any good thinly sliced ham will be delicious here', '2 tablespoons red wine vinegar', '1 teaspoon sugar']

Instructions:
Preheat oven to 475°F. Place dough on a rimmed baking sheet and drizzle with 1 Tbsp. oil; turn to coat. Stretch dough outward with your hands until it covers the entire sheet (it should be thin, which is what you want). If dough springs back, let it rest a few minutes to relax before stretching again.
Mix garlic and 2 Tbsp. oil in a small bowl. Drizzle over dough, using your hands to spread across entire surface; season with salt and pepper. Bake dough, rotating baking sheet once, until golden, puffed, and crisp all over, 10–12 minutes. Let cool slightly (so lettuce won’t wilt).
Toss lettuce, Gorgonzola, pickled onion, and chives in a large bowl; season with salt and pepper. Whisk vinegar and sugar in another small bowl, then, whisking constantly, gradually stream in remaining 1/3 cup oil. Pour dressing over salad and toss to coat.
Arrange salad on top of pizza crust and drape prosciutto over. Slice pizza into squares.
