Brownie Ice Cream Cake

Ingredients
cooking spray

all-purpose flour for dusting

1 (18.4 ounce) package brownie mix

½ cup vegetable oil

¼ cup water

2 large eggs

1 quart mint chocolate chip ice cream, or as needed

1 (14 ounce) can sweetened condensed milk

½ cup semi-sweet chocolate chips

1 (8 ounce) container frozen whipped topping, thawed (Optional)

Directions
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease and flour two 9-inch cake pans.

Combine brownie mix, oil, water, and eggs in a mixing bowl; stir well with a spoon until thickened and smooth, about 1 minute. Spread batter into the prepared cake pans.

Bake in the preheated oven until set and browned, about 30 minutes. A toothpick inserted into the center of a pan should come out with moist crumbs. Let cool for 10 minutes in pans before removing to finish cooling on racks.

After brownies are cool, remove ice cream from the freezer and allow to soften for about 10 minutes.

Meanwhile, pour sweetened condensed milk into a saucepan and mix in chocolate chips; heat over low heat, stirring constantly, just until chips have melted and sauce is smooth. Remove from heat and allow to cool to barely warm temperature.

Place one of the layers of brownies into the bottom of a 9-inch springform pan. Evenly spread ice cream in a layer over brownies; pour and spread 1/2 of the chocolate sauce over ice cream. Top with the other brownie layer, and drizzle remaining sauce over the top.

Freeze until ready to eat, at least 1 hour.

Serve topped with whipped topping.
