Caramel Macchiato Ice Cream

Ingredients
1 cup milk

1 cup white sugar

2 tablespoons instant coffee granules

1 pinch salt

2 cups heavy cream

Â¾ cup caramel dessert sauce

Directions
Whisk together milk, sugar, instant coffee granules, and salt in a large bowl until sugar is dissolved. Stir in heavy cream. Cover the bowl and refrigerate until chilled, at least 2 hours.

Pour chilled mixture into an ice cream maker and freeze according to manufacturer's directions until it reaches soft-serve consistency. Transfer 12 of the ice cream to a one- or two-quart lidded plastic container. Pour 12 of the caramel sauce over the top, then repeat the layers with remaining ice cream and caramel. Swirl caramel into ice cream using a chopstick or knife.

Cover ice cream surface with plastic wrap to seal. Allow ice cream to ripen in the freezer for at least 2 hours or overnight for best results.

Tips
I place a layer of wax paper firmly against the ice cream surface after removing from the ice cream maker and before freezing. This helps to keep out any freezer flavors.

The longer you freeze the ice cream, the firmer it will be.
