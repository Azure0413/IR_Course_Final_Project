['1⁄3 cup (80ml) vegetable oil', '1⁄4 cup (60ml) freshly squeezed lemon juice', '1⁄4 cup (60ml) distilled white vinegar', '2 garlic cloves', '2 sprigs fresh mint', '2 sprigs fresh dill', '1⁄2 tablespoon kosher salt', '1 teaspoon low-sodium soy sauce', '1 teaspoon garlic powder', '1 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper', '1⁄2 teaspoon dried oregano', '1⁄4 teaspoon red pepper flakes', '1⁄4 teaspoon ground cardamom', '1 1⁄2 pounds (680g) boneless, skinless chicken breasts or thighs, cut into 1-inch (2.5cm) chunks', '4 super-soft hero rolls, split lengthwise', 'Shredded iceberg lettuce', 'chopped tomatoes', 'chopped white onion', 'sliced pepperoncini', 'and chopped olives']

In a blender, combine the oil, lemon juice, vinegar, garlic, mint, dill, salt, soy sauce, garlic powder, black pepper, oregano, red pepper flakes, and cardamom and puree until smooth and emulsified.
Put the chicken in a large mixing bowl and pour the marinade over it, reserving about 1⁄2 cup marinade in a small bowl, and covering and refrigerating it. Mix the chicken well with the marinade, cover, and refrigerate for at least 4 hours or up to 24. The acidic marinade will start to break down the chicken, so if a more tender texture bothers you, marinate for 4 to 5 hours. I, however, am a fan of that texture and think an aggressively long, 24-hour marinade gives the chicken that much more flavor.
Heat a grill until it is so hot you (almost) can’t look directly at it. Skewer the chicken; you can make a giant skewer to save space or lots of little ones for easier turning. Cook the skewered chicken, turning three times, until nicely charred, 5 to 7 minutes on each of the four sides. Let the chicken rest for 10 minutes, then take it off the skewers.
To serve on the rolls, top with whichever of the following makes you the happiest: lettuce, tomatoes, onion, reserved marinade, pepperoncini, olives. Or don’t use any toppings, as it’s meant to be eaten, in my book (which this literally is).
