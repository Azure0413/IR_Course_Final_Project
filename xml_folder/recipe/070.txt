['1 package (14 to 16 ounces) firm tofu, drained, patted dry, and cut into 8 pieces', '⅓ cup soy sauce', '¼ cup hot chile sauce, such as Sriracha or sambal oelek chile sauce', '1 serrano chile, halved, seeded if desired', '⅓ cup chopped fresh cilantro leaves', '6 garlic cloves, coarsely chopped', '1 tablespoon coarsely chopped peeled fresh ginger', 'Peanut oil, for frying', '½ cup cornstarch', '5 ounces baby kale or spinach', '2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil', 'Fine sea salt to taste', 'Sliced scallions (white and green parts)', 'for garnish']

Arrange the tofu on a plate or baking sheet. In a blender, combine the soy sauce, chile sauce, chile halves, cilantro, garlic, and ginger; puree until smooth.
Using a pastry brush, coat the tofu on both sides with two-thirds of the chile mixture (reserve the rest for serving). Cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 1 hour and up to 6 hours.
Fill a 12-inch skillet with ½ inch of peanut oil and heat it over medium-high heat. Dip the slabs of tofu in the cornstarch, coating both sides, and tap off the excess.
Working in batches, add the tofu to the hot oil and cook, turning it over once, until it is golden brown, 1 to 2 minutes per side. Transfer the tofu to a paper-towel-lined plate to drain off the excess oil.
In a large bowl, toss the kale with the olive oil and fine sea salt to taste. Add the tofu and toss. Some of the kale will wilt, which is what you want. Serve hot, topped with sliced scallions and cilantro leaves, and with the reserved chile marinade alongside for drizzling.
