['1 1/2 cups green lentils, rinsed', '3/4 tsp. kosher salt, divided, plus more', '1 1/3 cups plain Greek yogurt', '2 garlic cloves, finely chopped', '1/2 tsp. ground turmeric', 'Freshly ground black pepper', '1 cup unsalted, roasted sunflower seeds', '1 Tbsp. plus 1 1/2 tsp. fresh lemon juice', '3 Tbsp. extra-virgin olive oil, plus more for drizzling', '1 ripe avocado, cut into cubes', '1 cup baby arugula', '1 cup basil leaves', 'torn if large']

Cook lentils in a large saucepan of simmering salted water until they are tender but still retain their shape, 20â€“30 minutes. Drain, rinse under cold running water, and drain well again.
Mix yogurt, garlic, turmeric, 1/4 tsp. salt, and a generous grind of pepper in a small bowl to combine; set aside.
Toss lentils, sunflower seeds, lemon juice, 3 Tbsp. oil, and remaining 1/2 tsp. salt in a large bowl. Gently fold in avocado, arugula, and basil.
Spread reserved yogurt sauce across a platter and spoon lentil mixture on top; drizzle with oil.
