Ingredients:
['1/2 cup shelled fresh peas (from about 8 oz. pods), pods reserved', 'Kosher salt', '1 serrano chile, thinly sliced', '1/4 cup kimchi juice (from a jar of kimchi)', '3 Tbsp. white or regular soy sauce', '2 Tbsp. unseasoned rice vinegar', '1 tsp. sugar', '1/2 tsp. finely grated peeled ginger', '1/2 tsp. toasted sesame oil', '1/2 tsp. chili oil, plus more for serving', '6 oz. dried soba noodles', '2 bunches small radishes (any variety), trimmed, thinly sliced into rounds', '2 cups pea shoots (tendrils) and/or baby arugula', '1 cup tatsoi or watercress', '4 Jammy Soft-Boiled Eggs, quartered', 'Sliced scallions (for serving)']

Instructions:
Cook peas in a large saucepan of boiling salted water until tender, about 2 minutes. Drain; transfer to a bowl of ice water. Let cool; drain and set aside.
Bring pea pods and 1 1/2 cups water to a boil in a small saucepan over medium heat. Reduce heat and simmer until pods are softened, 20â€“30 minutes. Drain through a fine-mesh sieve into a medium bowl; discard solids. Cover and chill pea stock until cold, about 30 minutes. (This is a great way to make use of vegetable trimmings, but you can use store-bought vegetable broth instead.)
Whisk chile, kimchi juice, soy sauce, vinegar, sugar, ginger, sesame oil, and 1/2 tsp. chili oil into pea stock. Set stock mixture aside.
Cook noodles in a pot of boiling salted water until tender. Drain and transfer to a bowl of ice water. Swish noodles around in the bowl with your hands to help them cool, then drain.
Add noodles to bowl with reserved stock mixture along with radishes, pea shoots, tatsoi, and reserved peas and toss gently to combine. Divide noodles, vegetables, and stock mixture among bowls; top with eggs and scallions and drizzle with a little chili oil.
