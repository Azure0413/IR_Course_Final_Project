Ice Cream Cupcakes

Ingredients
1 (18.25 ounce) package chocolate cake mix

1 ¼ cups water

⅓ cup vegetable oil

3 eggs

1 (1.5 quart) container vanilla ice cream, softened

1 (16 ounce) container prepared chocolate fudge frosting

Directions
Preheat an oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease or line 24 cupcake or muffin cups with paper baking liners.

Stir cake mix, water, oil and eggs in large bowl until moistened. Beat with a mixer on medium speed for 2 minutes or whisk by hand for 2 minutes. Drop 2 tablespoons of batter into each cupcake cup. Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the cake comes clean, about 8 to 10 minutes. When the cupcakes have cooled completely, cover and freeze until hard, about 4 hours.

Spoon about 1/2 cup of the softened ice cream into each cup and gently pack it into the cup. Cover and return to the freezer until frozen, about 4 hours. Frost the cupcakes with the prepared frosting and serve.

Cook's Note
I used the recipe for Simple 'N' Delicious Chocolate Cake, vanilla ice cream, and fudge frosting to make a classic cupcake for my toddler. I made the number 2's from buttercream frosting that I piped onto wax paper and froze for 4 hours. Ganache also works really well on these cupcakes, but the numbers of combinations are endless!
