Ingredients:
['1 medium bunch curly kale, ribs and stems removed, leaves coarsely chopped (about 4 cups)', '1 1/4 cups unsweetened coconut flakes', '1/3 cup nutritional yeast', '1/2 tsp. kosher salt, plus more', '2 Tbsp. plus 1/2 cup extra-virgin olive oil', '8 oz. dried soba noodles', '3 Tbsp. tahini', '2 Tbsp. plus 2 tsp. soy sauce', '1 Tbsp. honey', '2 tsp. toasted sesame oil, plus more for drizzling', '1/2 tsp. crushed red pepper flakes, plus more for serving', '1 lime']

Instructions:
Place racks in upper and lower thirds of oven and preheat to 375°F. Toss kale, coconut, nutritional yeast, 1/2 tsp. salt, and 2 Tbsp. olive oil in a large bowl to coat. Divide mixture evenly between 2 rimmed baking sheets and roast, tossing and rotating baking sheets halfway through, until kale is crisp and coconut is golden brown, 15–20 minutes.
While kale is roasting, cook noodles in a large pot of boiling water according to package directions. Drain and rinse under cold running water. Shake off any residual water and place noodles in a clean large bowl.
Combine tahini, soy sauce, honey, 2 tsp. sesame oil, 1/2 tsp. red pepper flakes, and remaining 1/2 cup olive oil in a small bowl. Finely grate zest from lime directly into bowl; halve lime and squeeze in juice (about 2 Tbsp.). Whisk dressing until smooth, then pour about half of it over noodles; toss to coat.
Add half of kale mixture to noodles and toss to incorporate. Drizzle in more dressing as needed, tossing until noodles are creamy; season with salt. Pile remaining kale on top. Drizzle with additional sesame oil and sprinkle with more red pepper flakes.
