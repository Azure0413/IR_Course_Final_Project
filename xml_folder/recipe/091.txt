Coconut-Avocado Ice Cream

Ingredients
1 ½ cups milk

1 cup coconut cream

½ cup white sugar

2 (1/2 pound) avocados, peeled and pitted

¾ teaspoon lemon juice

Directions
Puree milk, coconut cream, sugar, avocados, and lemon juice in a blender until smooth. Pour into a bowl, cover, and refrigerate for several hours until cold. Freeze in an ice cream machine according to manufacturer's directions, then freeze overnight.

Allow ice cream to soften in refrigerator for 10 minutes before serving.

Note
If you don't have an ice cream machine, you can make this in the freezer. Just pour the puree into a dish and place it into the freezer. Freeze for about 2 to 3 hours, then mash it into a slush; repeat the freezing and mashing about 3 to 4 times so that the ice cream will be smooth. Finally, freeze overnight and serve as directed.
