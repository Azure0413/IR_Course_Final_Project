['Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper', '1 bunch red radishes, cut into ⅛-inch slices', '2 tablespoons red wine vinegar', '4 teaspoons extra-virgin olive oil', '½ red onion, cut into thin slivers', '4½ pounds watermelon (1/4 of a large melon), rind removed, flesh cut into 1-inch cubes', '2 tablespoons torn mint leaves']

Dissolve a spoonful of salt in a large bowl of ice and water. Add the radishes and let sit for a few minutes to crisp.
Whisk the vinegar, oil, and 1 teaspoon salt in a large bowl. Drain the radishes and add to the bowl, along with the onion and watermelon.
Gently toss with your hands to coat evenly.
Spread on a serving platter, grind pepper all over, and top with the mint.
