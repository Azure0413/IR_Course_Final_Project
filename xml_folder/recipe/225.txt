Ingredients:
['1 cup warm water', '1 teaspoon sugar', '2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil, plus more for pan', '1 (1/4-ounce) packet active dried yeast (about 1 1/4 teaspoons)', '2 1/2 cups high-gluten bread flour', '1 cup semolina flour,* plus more for dusting', '1 1/2 teaspoons salt', '1 cup nasturtium flowers', "*If you can't find semolina, substitute high-gluten bread flour.", 'About 3 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil', '1/3 cup herb flower pesto', 'About 1/2 cup (4 ounces) goat cheese', '1/3 cup nasturtium flowers', 'Other toppings of your choice']

Instructions:
1. Put warm water, sugar, and oil in the bowl of a mixer fitted with the dough hook. Add yeast and let it sit for 10 minutes, until mixture foams. In a medium bowl, stir to combine flours, salt, and nasturtium flowers. Sprinkle flour mixture into yeast mixture. Mix on low speed for 5 minutes, until dough is smooth and bouncy. Cover the bowl with a cotton kitchen towel and let stand for about 1 hour, or until dough has doubled in volume.
2. Turn dough onto a surface dusted with flour and knead by pushing it away from your body with the heel of your hand, folding it over, and repeating about 12 times. Divide dough into two balls. At this point, dough can be baked or stored for up to 2 days in the refrigerator on a baking sheet covered with plastic wrap.
3. Preheat oven to 450Â°F. Rub two baking sheets with olive oil and dust with semolina flour. Stretch out each dough ball by tapping and pressing outward from the center with your fingertips. Transfer to prepared baking sheets. Cover with toppings of your choice. Bake pizzas for 20 to 25 minutes, rotating sheets halfway through baking so the dough browns evenly. Slice, serve, and enjoy.
