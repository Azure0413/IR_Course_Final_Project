['3/4 cup sour cream', '1/4 cup mayonnaise', '1 garlic clove, finely grated', '2 tsp. finely grated lemon zest', '3 Tbsp. fresh lemon juice', '1 1/2 tsp. kosher salt', '1 1/2 tsp. freshly ground black pepper', '1 head of iceberg lettuce (about 1 lb.)', '2 avocados, halved and cut into wedges', '1 Tbsp. fresh lemon juice', '1 small bunch chives', 'cut into 1" pieces']

Whisk sour cream, mayonnaise, garlic, lemon zest, lemon juice, salt, and pepper in a medium bowl to combine.
Do Ahead: Dressing can be made 1 day ahead. Cover and chill.
Trim root end of lettuce; discard any wilted outer leaves. Cut into quarters lengthwise, then cut each quarter crosswise into 3" pieces. Without separating wedges into leaves, transfer to a large platter. Tuck avocado pieces among lettuce and drizzle lemon juice over; season with salt.
Spoon half of dressing over salad and top with chives; season with pepper. Serve with remaining dressing alongside.
