['1 lb. firm white skinless fish fillets (such as mahi-mahi, cod, or halibut), cut into 2" pieces', 'Kosher salt, freshly ground pepper', '1 Tbsp. fresh lemon juice', '1 Tbsp. red wine vinegar', '1/2 tsp. Dijon mustard', '3 Tbsp. extra-virgin olive oil, divided', '1 cup dry or instant polenta (coarse cornmeal)', '1 garlic clove, smashed', '1 medium yellow bell pepper, seeds and ribs removed, cut into 2" pieces', '1 medium zucchini, cut into 2" pieces', '1 pint cherry or grape tomatoes, halved', '1 Tbsp. slivered fresh basil (or 1 tsp. dried), plus whole leaves for serving', '1 tsp. chopped fresh oregano (or 1/2 tsp. dried)', 'plus whole leaves for serving']

Season fish with salt and pepper. Whisk lemon juice, vinegar, mustard, and 2 Tbsp. oil in a medium bowl. Add fish, toss to coat, and chill until ready to use.
Cook polenta according to package directions.
Meanwhile, heat remaining 1 Tbsp. oil in a large skillet over medium-high. Cook garlic, stirring occasionally, until beginning to brown, about 2 minutes. Transfer garlic to a plate.
Cook bell pepper in same skillet, stirring frequently, until beginning to brown and soften, about 3 minutes. Add zucchini, cover, and cook 3 minutes.
Reduce heat to medium-low. Add tomatoes, garlic, fish and dressing, 1 Tbsp. slivered basil, and 1 tsp. chopped oregano; season with salt and pepper. Cover and simmer just until fish is cooked through, about 5 minutes. Discard garlic, if desired.
Divide polenta among bowls. Arrange fish mixture over. Garnish with basil and oregano.
