['4 Tbsp. extra-virgin olive oil, divided, plus more', '1 tsp. honey', '4 bone-in pork rib chops (about 1" thick), patted dry', 'Kosher salt, freshly ground pepper', '4 ripe medium red or black plums (about 1 lb.), halved', '1 lemon, halved, seeds removed', '8 oz. Halloumi cheese, sliced into 1/2"-thick planks', '2 Tbsp. torn oregano leaves', 'Aleppo-style pepper or crushed red pepper flakes (for serving)']

Prepare a grill for medium-high heat; oil grate. Combine honey and 2 Tbsp. oil in a large resealable plastic bag. Season pork chops generously with salt and pepper and add to bag. Seal, pressing out air, and massage chops to coat.
Place plums, lemon, and Halloumi on a rimmed baking sheet and drizzle with 2 Tbsp. oil; toss to coat. Season plums and lemon with salt, then season everything with pepper.
Grill pork over medium-high, turning occasionally with tongs and moving around if needed to prevent flare-ups, until an instant-read thermometer inserted into the center (about 1/2" from the bone) registers 130°F, 6–8 minutes. Transfer to a cutting board and let rest 10 minutes.
Meanwhile, grill plums, lemon (cut side down), and Halloumi, turning plums and cheese once or twice, until grill marks appear and plums start to release their juices, about 4 minutes. Transfer plums, lemon, and Halloumi to cutting board with pork and let cool 1 minute. Slice each plum half into 3 wedges and tear Halloumi into 1" pieces.
Cut pork away from bone and slice 1/2" thick. Arrange meat on plates; discard bones. Spoon plums and Halloumi around and on top of meat, dividing evenly. Squeeze juice from grilled lemon over; season with more salt and pepper. Top with oregano, sprinkle with some Aleppo-style pepper, and drizzle with a little oil.
