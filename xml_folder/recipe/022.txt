['12 garlic cloves', '1/4 cup chopped rosemary', '2 Tbsp kosher salt', '1 (4-rib) standing beef rib roast (bone-in prime rib; 9 to 10 lb)']

Pulse garlic, rosemary, salt, and 1 tsp pepper in a food processor until smooth, then rub all over roast. Transfer to a rack set in a 13- by 9-inch roasting pan and marinate, chilled, at least 8 hours.
Let roast stand at room temperature 1 hour.
Preheat oven to 450째F with rack in middle. Roast meat, fat side up, 20 minutes. Reduce oven temperature to 350째F and roast until an instant-read thermometer inserted into center of meat (do not touch bone) registers 110째F, 1 1/2 to 2 hours more. Transfer to a platter and let rest, uncovered, 30 minutes (temperature of meat will rise to about 130째F for medium-rare).
Beef can be marinated 1 day ahead.
