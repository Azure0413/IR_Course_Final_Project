Ingredients:
['Salt', '1 cup stone-ground polenta', '1/2 pound fresh mozzarella', '1/2 cup grated Parmigiano-Reggiano or Pecorino Romano cheese', 'Extra virgin olive oil for drizzling', 'Leaves from 1 bunch dried fresh sage (see Note)', 'Red pepper flakes', 'Pepper']

Instructions:
1. Bring 4 cups water to a boil in a large heavy saucepan and add 2 teaspoons salt. Whisk in the polenta and continue whisking as it begins to bubble. After a minute or two, when the polenta has thickened a bit, reduce the heat to low and let cook gently, stirring occasionally, for about 45 minutes, until thickened and smooth, with no raw cornmeal taste. If the polenta gets too thick as it cooks, add a bit more water. Remove a spoonful and cool, then taste and adjust the seasoning, if necessary.
2. Spread the polenta on a lightly oiled baking dish to a thickness of 1/2 inch. Let cool and set, preferably overnight, in the refrigerator.
3. Heat the oven to 400Â°F, with a rack in the top third. Tear the mozzarella into big shreds and scatter over the polenta. Top with the Parmesan. Drizzle lightly with oil and crumble the sage leaves on top.
4. Bake the polenta until the cheese is bubbling and lightly browned, 10 to 15 minutes. Sprinkle with red pepper flakes and freshly ground black pepper to taste and let cool slightly.
5. Serve cut into rough wedges or squares.
