['1 pound good-quality spaghetti', '1 tablespoon butter', '3 large eggs, beaten', '1 cup homemade red sauce or prepared tomato sauce', '1/4 teaspoon coarsely ground black pepper', 'Pinch of salt', '3 ounces mozzarella cheese, grated (about 1 cup)', '1 1/2 ounces Parmesan cheese', 'grated (about 1/2 cup)']

Cook the pasta in generously salted water according to the package directions until just shy of al dente. Drain and set aside.
Preheat the oven to 400Â°F. Butter a 9-inch springform pan (see Note) and set aside.
In a large bowl, stir together the eggs, red sauce, pepper, salt, and all but 1 tablespoon each of the mozzarella and Parmesan. Add the pasta and toss to coat evenly. Transfer to the prepared springform pan and sprinkle with the reserved cheeses.
Bake until the top is nicely browned and crisp, 30 to 35 minutes. Let cool for 5 minutes before unmolding.
