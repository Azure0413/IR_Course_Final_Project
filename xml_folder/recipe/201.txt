Italian Lemon Ice

Ingredients
5 cups water

⅔ cup white sugar

2 teaspoons grated lemon zest

¾ cup freshly squeezed lemon juice

12 leaves fresh mint, or as needed

1 lemon, cut into wedges

1 fluid ounce raspberry-flavored liqueur (such as Chambord) (Optional)

Directions
Whisk water, sugar, and lemon zest together in a medium saucepan; bring to a boil over high heat. Whisk and boil for 5 minutes. Cool 10 minutes, then whisk in lemon juice.

Transfer lemon mixture to an 8x8-inch pan; freeze 1 1/2 hours.

Remove pan from freezer; stir with a fork to break up ice. Freeze 3 hours more. Scrape and mix ice into shavings with a fork.

Serve in chilled glasses; garnish with mint and lemon wedges. Top with raspberry-flavored liqueur.

Cook's Note:
You can substitute orange zest and juice for lemon.
